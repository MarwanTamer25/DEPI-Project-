# Project 2: Malware Analysis and Prevention Strategy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing different types of malware, developing a malware prevention strategy, and implementing **Splunk** as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for real-time monitoring and detection. Through in-depth malware research and the use of Splunk, the project aims to strengthen an organization's defenses against malware threats.

## Key Objectives
1. **Malware Analysis**: Conduct detailed analyses of three specific types of malware: **Cybervolk Ransomware**, **Emotet Malware**, and **Adware**. Each malware type is studied to understand its behavior, attack methods, and impact on systems.
   
2. **Splunk SIEM Configuration and Monitoring**: Set up and configure **Splunk** as a SIEM platform to monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of malware-related events. The system is configured to generate alerts for suspicious activities, enabling rapid detection and response.

3. **Malware Prevention Strategy**: Develop a strategy to prevent malware infections by integrating security policies, technical controls, and user training. The strategy addresses ways to safeguard the organization's systems and minimize the risk of malware infiltration.

4. **User Awareness Training**: Create training materials aimed at raising awareness among users about malware risks, best security practices, and how to avoid falling victim to malware attacks.

## Malware Analysis Reports
The project includes in-depth analysis reports for the following malware types:
1. **Cybervolk Ransomware Analysis Report**: A report detailing the behavior, attack methodology, and potential impact of the Cybervolk ransomware, including its encryption techniques and ransom demands.
   
2. **Emotet Malware Analysis Report**: A comprehensive analysis of the Emotet malware, known for its ability to spread via email and deliver other payloads such as ransomware or banking Trojans.
   
3. **Adware Analysis Report**: A detailed examination of adware, its methods of delivery, and how it affects user experience by displaying unwanted advertisements and collecting user data.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Splunk**: Used as the SIEM system for real-time malware monitoring, event correlation, and alerting.
- **Security Analysis Tools**: Various tools used for the research and analysis of the identified malware.
- **Documentation Tools**: Markdown, Word, and PowerPoint for producing reports and presentations.

## Conclusion
This project offers a deep understanding of malware threats through specific analyses of Cybervolk ransomware, Emotet malware, and adware. By implementing Splunk as a SIEM solution and developing a comprehensive prevention strategy, the organization is better equipped to detect, respond to, and prevent future malware attacks.
