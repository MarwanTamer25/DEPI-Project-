# Project 2: Malware Analysis and Prevention Strategy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of various types of malware, developing a malware prevention strategy, and implementing **Splunk** as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for real-time monitoring and detection. By leveraging in-depth malware research and the use of Splunk, this project strengthens organizational defenses against malware threats.

## Objectives
1. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze three specific types of malware—**Cybervolk Ransomware**, **Emotet Malware**, and **Adware**—to understand their behaviors, attack methods, and potential system impacts.
   
2. **Splunk SIEM Configuration and Monitoring**: Configure **Splunk** as a SIEM platform to monitor network traffic and system activity for malware-related events. The SIEM generates alerts for suspicious activities, enabling prompt detection and response.

3. **Malware Prevention Strategy**: Create a comprehensive prevention strategy, including security policies, technical controls, and user awareness training to safeguard the organization against malware.

4. **User Awareness Training**: Develop training materials aimed at educating users on how to recognize and avoid malware threats by following security best practices.

5. **Final Report and Presentation**: Compile the findings from the malware analyses, Splunk SIEM configuration, and prevention strategy into a final report and presentation.

## Malware Analysis Reports
Below are the links to the detailed analysis reports for each malware type:
1. **[Cybervolk Ransomware Analysis Report](./MalwareAnalysisReports/Cybervolk_Ransomware_Analysis_Report.pdf)**: A comprehensive analysis of the Cybervolk ransomware, focusing on its attack methodology, encryption techniques, and potential system damage.
   
2. **[Emotet Malware Analysis Report](./MalwareAnalysisReports/Emotet_Malware_Analysis_Report.pdf)**: A detailed study of Emotet malware, covering its infection methods, network propagation, and its capability to deliver other malware payloads.

3. **[Adware Analysis Report](./MalwareAnalysisReports/Adware_Analysis_Report.pdf)**: An examination of adware, its delivery mechanisms, and its effects on user experience, including the display of unwanted advertisements and data collection.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Splunk**: Used as the SIEM system for real-time monitoring, event correlation, and alerting against malware activity.
- **Security Analysis Tools**: Various tools used to conduct detailed research and analysis of malware.
- **Documentation Tools**: Markdown, Word, and PowerPoint for reports and presentations.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of malware threats, including Cybervolk ransomware, Emotet malware, and adware. By implementing **Splunk** for SIEM and developing a robust malware prevention strategy, the organization is better equipped to detect, respond to, and prevent future malware attacks.
